# Hytopia Map Compression - Custom Configuration
# Copy this file to assets/config/map-compression.yaml to customize settings
# The plugin will automatically load it if present

# Only include the settings you want to override - defaults are sensible

# Example: Enable debug logging
logging:
  enabled: true  # Show detailed logs during compression/loading

# Example: Use different map location
paths:
  mapFile: ./maps/my-custom-map.json

# Example: Disable pre-computed chunks (if you're low on disk space)
autoLoad:
  preferChunks: false

# Example: Use lower compression for faster processing
compression:
  level: 6  # Default is 9 (maximum compression)

# Example: Simple mode - only compression/decompression, no fancy optimizations
autoLoad:
  compressionOnly: true  # Disables chunks, monkey patching, etc.
